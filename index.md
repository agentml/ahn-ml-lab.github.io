I'm an Associate Professor in the [School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr) at [KAIST](https://kaist.ac.kr) and also an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Rutgers University, affiliated with the Rutgers Center for Cognitive Science. I lead the [Agent and Machine Learning Lab](http://www.sungjinahn.com) at KAIST and Rutgers. My research interest is to develop machine learning algorithms to make human-like general-purposed intelligent agents. In pursuing this, I'm particularly interested in learning representations, world models, and policies in interactive, self-supervised, and structured ways (e.g., causal, compositional, temporal, and hierarchical) with the tools of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and probabilistic learning. I also enjoy being inspired by Cognitive Science to discover novel problems and inductive biases. I received my Ph.D. at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu) on the study of scalable approximate Bayesian inference under the supervision of Prof. [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/). I did my postdoc working on deep learning at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/) under Prof. [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/).
